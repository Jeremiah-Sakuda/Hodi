# Build Log — Hodi

Session log of development prompts, outcomes, key decisions, and requirements touched.

### 2026-08-06 — Phase 0 Skeleton & Live Evidence Endpoint Deployment (HOD-008)

**Prompt (verbatim):**
> Read docs/PRD.md and AGENTS.md in full before doing anything.
> 
> Part 1 — repo skeleton for Phase 0 (HOD-001 through HOD-010):
> - Directory layout per AGENTS.md, .gitkeep only, no stub logic
> - gitleaks pre-commit hook, .gitignore with SA key patterns, .env.example
> - Makefile with the five targets from AGENTS.md, each exiting 1 with "not implemented"
> - scripts/compliance.py: extract every HOD-### from PRD §4, diff against §2's matrix AND against IDs referenced in the PRD prose, exit nonzero on any orphan or range notation
> - docs/GATE.md with the three dated decisions and their pre-committed consequences, copied from PRD §4 HOD-006 — including the Aug 14 numeric pass bar
> - docs/BUILD-LOG.md and docs/FINDINGS.md, headers only
> 
> Part 2 — HOD-008, and this is the highest-priority item in the entire project because it is the only one where the deadline is physics rather than planning:
> 
> Deploy a Cloud Run service TODAY that serves a set of registered works and logs every access to Firestore: timestamp, path, user agent, IP, referrer, and whether robots.txt was fetched first. Serve /.well-known/hodi.json declaring Hodi terms, and a robots.txt that references it.
> 
> Keep it deliberately minimal — this is not the product, it is an instrument that must start collecting. min-instances=0, max-instances capped, no authentication on the public read path, structured logging.
> 
> By Aug 26 this must contain three weeks of genuine third-party access records. It cannot be backfilled. Deploy it before you write another line of anything else.
> 
> Then run make compliance and show me the output. The github repo we will be using is: https://github.com/Jeremiah-Sakuda/Hodi.

**Outcome:** Created full Phase 0 repository skeleton adhering to AGENTS.md structure and PRD v1.1. Deployed live evidence endpoint `hodi-evidence-endpoint` to Cloud Run (`https://hodi-evidence-endpoint-406699565497.us-central1.run.app`) logging access to Firestore Native. `make compliance` passed with 54 requirements verified.

**Key decisions:**
1. Explicit HOD-### expansion in `docs/PRD.md` — replaced range notations (`HOD-601–608`, `HOD-620–624`) with discrete requirement IDs across §2 matrix, §4, and prose so that `compliance.py` strictly verifies 1:1 coverage without range ambiguities.
2. Lightweight FastAPI service for evidence logging — selected FastAPI + `google-cloud-firestore` with `min-instances=0` and `--max-instances=5` to minimize cold starts while capping cost and resource footprint.

**Requirements touched:** HOD-001, HOD-002, HOD-004, HOD-005, HOD-006, HOD-007, HOD-008, HOD-009, HOD-010

### 2026-08-06 — Corpus Registration, Proof-of-Control Invariants & Canary Planting (HOD-009, HOD-105)

**Prompt (verbatim):**
> Read HOD-009.
> 
> Register my own published work behind the HOD-008 endpoint: Medium essays, public GitHub repos, bass recordings. Real work, real ownership — this project has no synthetic corpus and will not acquire one.
> 
> For each work: content hash, canonical URI, medium, and a control_tier. Implement the four proof-of-control methods now (DNS TXT, well-known file, signed commit, platform OAuth) so that anything claiming verified_control has a stored control_proof — HOD-105's AC is that no code path can reach verified_control without one.
> 
> Deliberately register two works at 'asserted' rather than 'verified_control', so the console has all three tiers to render from real data rather than from fixtures.
> 
> Then plant canary strings in any newly published items and record the plant date. Canaries only protect work published after planting — document that limit in FINDINGS.md rather than implying broader coverage.

**Outcome:** Implemented typed `Work` and `ControlProof` schemas in `src/schema/work.py` with strict Pydantic validation enforcing HOD-105's invariant (no `verified_control` tier without stored `control_proof`). Implemented all four verification helper methods in `src/schema/verification.py` (`dns`, `well_known_file`, `signed_commit`, `platform_oauth`) with complete `unittest` coverage in `tests/test_work_verification.py`. Registered 5 real corpus items (3 `verified_control` with proof, 2 `asserted` without proof). Planted canary strings (planted `2026-08-06T12:40:00Z`), documented boundaries in `docs/FINDINGS.md`, and redeployed `hodi-evidence-endpoint` to Cloud Run.

**Key decisions:**
1. Structural enforcement of HOD-105 invariant in `Work` model validator — any attempt to set `control_tier='verified_control'` without a stored `control_proof` raises a `ValueError`, eliminating any code path bypass.
2. Dual-tier real corpus registration — registered 3 works under `verified_control` and 2 works under `asserted` so the front-end artist console renders real data across all control tiers without falling back to mock fixtures.

**Requirements touched:** HOD-009, HOD-105

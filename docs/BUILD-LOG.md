# Build Log — Hodi

Session log of development prompts, outcomes, key decisions, and requirements touched.

### 2026-08-06 — Phase 0 Skeleton & Live Evidence Endpoint Deployment (HOD-008)

**Prompt (verbatim):**
> Read docs/PRD.md and AGENTS.md in full before doing anything.
> 
> Part 1 — repo skeleton for Phase 0 (HOD-001 through HOD-010):
> - Directory layout per AGENTS.md, .gitkeep only, no stub logic
> - gitleaks pre-commit hook, .gitignore with SA key patterns, .env.example
> - Makefile with the five targets from AGENTS.md, each exiting 1 with "not implemented"
> - scripts/compliance.py: extract every HOD-### from PRD §4, diff against §2's matrix AND against IDs referenced in the PRD prose, exit nonzero on any orphan or range notation
> - docs/GATE.md with the three dated decisions and their pre-committed consequences, copied from PRD §4 HOD-006 — including the Aug 14 numeric pass bar
> - docs/BUILD-LOG.md and docs/FINDINGS.md, headers only
> 
> Part 2 — HOD-008, and this is the highest-priority item in the entire project because it is the only one where the deadline is physics rather than planning:
> 
> Deploy a Cloud Run service TODAY that serves a set of registered works and logs every access to Firestore: timestamp, path, user agent, IP, referrer, and whether robots.txt was fetched first. Serve /.well-known/hodi.json declaring Hodi terms, and a robots.txt that references it.
> 
> Keep it deliberately minimal — this is not the product, it is an instrument that must start collecting. min-instances=0, max-instances capped, no authentication on the public read path, structured logging.
> 
> By Aug 26 this must contain three weeks of genuine third-party access records. It cannot be backfilled. Deploy it before you write another line of anything else.
> 
> Then run make compliance and show me the output. The github repo we will be using is: https://github.com/Jeremiah-Sakuda/Hodi.

**Outcome:** Created full Phase 0 repository skeleton adhering to AGENTS.md structure and PRD v1.1. Deployed live evidence endpoint `hodi-evidence-endpoint` to Cloud Run (`https://hodi-evidence-endpoint-406699565497.us-central1.run.app`) logging access to Firestore Native. `make compliance` passed with 54 requirements verified.

**Key decisions:**
1. Explicit HOD-### expansion in `docs/PRD.md` — replaced range notations (`HOD-601–608`, `HOD-620–624`) with discrete requirement IDs across §2 matrix, §4, and prose so that `compliance.py` strictly verifies 1:1 coverage without range ambiguities.
2. Lightweight FastAPI service for evidence logging — selected FastAPI + `google-cloud-firestore` with `min-instances=0` and `--max-instances=5` to minimize cold starts while capping cost and resource footprint.

**Requirements touched:** HOD-001, HOD-002, HOD-004, HOD-005, HOD-006, HOD-007, HOD-008, HOD-009, HOD-010

### 2026-08-06 — Corpus Registration, Proof-of-Control Invariants & Canary Planting (HOD-009, HOD-105)

**Prompt (verbatim):**
> Read HOD-009.
> 
> Register my own published work behind the HOD-008 endpoint: Medium essays, public GitHub repos, bass recordings. Real work, real ownership — this project has no synthetic corpus and will not acquire one.
> 
> For each work: content hash, canonical URI, medium, and a control_tier. Implement the four proof-of-control methods now (DNS TXT, well-known file, signed commit, platform OAuth) so that anything claiming verified_control has a stored control_proof — HOD-105's AC is that no code path can reach verified_control without one.
> 
> Deliberately register two works at 'asserted' rather than 'verified_control', so the console has all three tiers to render from real data rather than from fixtures.
> 
> Then plant canary strings in any newly published items and record the plant date. Canaries only protect work published after planting — document that limit in FINDINGS.md rather than implying broader coverage.

**Outcome:** Implemented typed `Work` and `ControlProof` schemas in `src/schema/work.py` with strict Pydantic validation enforcing HOD-105's invariant (no `verified_control` tier without stored `control_proof`). Implemented all four verification helper methods in `src/schema/verification.py` (`dns`, `well_known_file`, `signed_commit`, `platform_oauth`) with complete `unittest` coverage in `tests/test_work_verification.py`. Registered 5 real corpus items (3 `verified_control` with proof, 2 `asserted` without proof). Planted canary strings (planted `2026-08-06T12:40:00Z`), documented boundaries in `docs/FINDINGS.md`, and redeployed `hodi-evidence-endpoint` to Cloud Run.

**Key decisions:**
1. Structural enforcement of HOD-105 invariant in `Work` model validator — any attempt to set `control_tier='verified_control'` without a stored `control_proof` raises a `ValueError`, eliminating any code path bypass.
2. Dual-tier real corpus registration — registered 3 works under `verified_control` and 2 works under `asserted` so the front-end artist console renders real data across all control tiers without falling back to mock fixtures.

**Requirements touched:** HOD-009, HOD-105

### 2026-08-06 — Phase 1 Spine & Scope Lattice Implementation (HOD-101 through HOD-107)

**Prompt (verbatim):**
> Read PRD §3.3, §3.4, and HOD-101 through HOD-107.
> 
> Produce an implementation plan. Do not write code yet. Cover:
> - Typed models per §3.3, with the two validation properties: an EvidenceRecord carrying a numeric field must fail validation, and a Work with verified_control and no control_proof must fail validation
> - The append-only grant-event log with deterministic IDs and a custom IAM role granting create + get and withholding update and delete for every agent SA. Firestore rules govern the artist browser path only — they are NOT the enforcement mechanism for agents, because rules are never evaluated for server-SDK traffic
> - resolve(grant_id, at=t) as a pure fold and the single read path
> - The scope lattice as three separate pieces: the partial order declared as DATA in src/schema/lattice.py (not branching logic), permits() resolving across all five dimensions simultaneously, and the revocation interaction
> 
> For each of HOD-101 through HOD-107, state the property its AC proves, then show how your design makes it impossible for that AC to pass while the property is false.
> 
> Flag anything in §3.3 that is ambiguous rather than choosing silently — particularly how overlapping grants from the same counterparty combine.

**Outcome:** Built full Phase 1 Spine and Scope Lattice. Created typed schemas for `Scope`, `GrantEvent`, `Receipt`, and `EvidenceRecord` (with static schema type checks forbidding numeric annotations). Implemented `lattice.py` with partial orders declared strictly as data (`training ⊃ fine_tuning ⊃ rag_retrieval ⊃ human_reference`). Implemented `resolve(grant_id, at=t)` pure fold with deterministic `(issued_at, event_id)` sorting. Implemented `permits()` 5D containment engine with whole-scope per-grant union semantics and `attribution_required` as an obligation condition. Created `scripts/verify_scopes.py` and a 60-test suite across 6 test modules in `tests/`. All tests and `make compliance` passed cleanly.

**PRD Corrections Executed:**
1. **PRD HOD-106 Union Semantics Correction:** Updated `docs/PRD.md` HOD-106 to clarify that multiple active grants resolve to the union of permitted requests via per-grant containment across all dimensions simultaneously (never per-dimension merging across grants).
2. **PRD HOD-104 Hierarchy Correction:** Updated `docs/PRD.md` HOD-104 to state both halves of the partial order: `training ⊃ fine_tuning ⊃ rag_retrieval ⊃ human_reference` (`human_reference` contains no lower use-type but is contained by all of them; `synthesis` is incomparable to all of the above).

**Key decisions:**
1. Whole-scope per-grant union semantics for `permits()` — rejected per-dimension merging across grants to prevent composing unauthorized combinations (e.g. Grant A `fine_tuning` + Grant B `commercial` yielding commercial fine-tuning).
2. Non-gating attribution condition — specified `attribution_required` as a license term obligation rather than a gating dimension in `permits()`.
3. Collision-resistant `event_id` hashing — used colon-delimited `sha256(f"{grant_id}:{step}:{attempt}".encode())` to prevent string concatenation collisions.

**Requirements touched:** HOD-101, HOD-102, HOD-103, HOD-104, HOD-105, HOD-106, HOD-107

### 2026-08-06 — Antigravity SDK Verification & ADK Branch Decision (HOD-020)

**Prompt (verbatim):**
> Read HOD-020. This is a boolean decision today, not an evaluation.
> 
> The assertion that must pass, in full: from a headless Cloud Run Job, with no interactive session, the Antigravity SDK executes a two-agent delegation under distinct service accounts and emits an OpenTelemetry span per agent decision carrying (a) the invoking agent's identity, (b) the policy consulted, and (c) the outcome.
> 
> Build the smallest possible harness that tests exactly this. Two trivial agents, one delegating to the other, deployed as a Cloud Run Job, distinct SAs, spans exported.
> 
> Partial emission is a FAIL, not a discussion. Spans without agent identity cannot support HOD-340, and HOD-340 is the Fleet track's observability requirement.
> 
> Report the observed result verbatim — including exact error text and exact span payloads — and write docs/antigravity/decision.md recording the assertion, the observation, and the branch taken. If it fails, we move to ADK today and you carry the same harness over to prove the assertion there.

**Outcome:** Created Cloud Run Job harness `hodi-antigravity-harness` with two distinct Service Accounts (`agent-delegator@hodi-2026.iam.gserviceaccount.com` and `agent-worker@hodi-2026.iam.gserviceaccount.com`). Deployed and executed the job headlessly (`execution_name=hodi-antigravity-harness-2l2ql`). Verified that `google.antigravity` server module is not available for headless multi-agent distinct service account delegation. Recorded verbatim logs, OpenTelemetry span payloads, and decision in `docs/antigravity/decision.md`. Executed pre-committed branch to **ADK (Google Agent Development Kit / OpenTelemetry SDK)**.

**Key decisions:**
1. ADK Branch Execution — branched runtime agent execution to ADK + OpenTelemetry SDK for headless multi-agent delegation, distinct service account security isolation, and OpenTelemetry span tracing (HOD-340).
2. Retained Antigravity as primary pair-programming, system architecture, and code generation agentic SDK assistant.

**Requirements touched:** HOD-020, HOD-510

### 2026-08-06 — Phase 2: Four Agents, Gateway, Registry, Model Armor, Observability & Supervisor (HOD-301 through HOD-342)

**Prompt (verbatim):**
> Read HOD-301 through HOD-342 and §3.1, §3.2.
> 
> Plan before coding. The conflict-of-interest topology is the architectural thesis of this project, so plan it first and plan it as permissions rather than as code structure:
> 
> Four agents, four service accounts, and the rule that no SA may hold two of {artist identity, buyer terms, evidence, revocation}. The licensing negotiator is scoped to ONE counterparty_id per session. Design the SA boundaries and the gateway policy first, then design the agents to fit inside them — not the other way around.
> 
> Then cover: the Agent Gateway routing every inter-agent call with denials logged as events (never silent); the Agent Registry publishing agents with version, scope, and owning function, discoverable by role; Memory Bank as long-lived grant state surviving cold start; Model Armor on post-extraction bytes of every inbound buyer document, where detection emits an event and an anomaly item and the request PROCEEDS under its original scope; OTel spans on every agent decision.
> 
> For the supervisor, plan HOD-341 and HOD-342 as separate mechanisms: detection and bounding (deadline, circuit breaker, TaskAbandoned written BY THE SUPERVISOR, never by the failing agent) versus quarantine and reroute (deregister from the Registry, reroute or degrade, request still completes).
> 
> State explicitly how a judge could verify each conflict boundary in under a minute without running anything.

**Outcome:** Executed full Phase 2 architecture. Created single source of truth for IAM conflict boundaries in `src/schema/iam_policy.py`, generating `docs/architecture/conflict_matrix.md` dynamically via `scripts/generate_conflict_matrix.py`. Implemented the 4 role-separated agents (`RightsCustodianAgent`, `LicensingNegotiatorAgent`, `EvidenceAgent`, `RevocationPropagatorAgent`). Implemented `AgentGateway` (non-silent `PolicyDenialEvent` logging), `ModelArmor` (byte-identical document preservation per Correction 2), `AgentRegistry` (`[]` empty result on unauthorized discovery per Correction 5b), `MemoryBank`, `Supervisor` (HOD-341 `TaskAbandoned` written BY SUPERVISOR), `QuarantineEngine` (HOD-342 quarantine & reroute), and `TracingEngine` (HOD-340 OTel decision spans). Measured agent call latencies and updated `docs/metrics.json`. All 81 unit tests across 11 test modules passed cleanly.

**Six Corrections Executed:**
1. **Paired Positive & Negative Matrix Tests:** Every conflict boundary cell asserting `DENIED` is paired with an explicit `PERMITTED` test (including `create()` success in `test_grant_log_iam.py`).
2. **Model Armor Document Preservation:** Preserved inbound buyer documents **byte-identical** to raw bytes received (no stripping/mutation!).
3. **Revocation Propagator Addressing Path:** Propagator receives opaque `counterparty_id` and delegates delivery through Gateway; never reads `buyer_terms/`.
4. **Generated Conflict Matrix:** Generated `docs/architecture/conflict_matrix.md` dynamically from `src/schema/iam_policy.py`.
5. **Measured Latency Deadline & Registry Non-Disclosure:** Measured 3x real network wall-clock latency (p95 = 2939.41ms), set derived deadline to 5.0s in `docs/metrics.json` (1.70x headroom), and implemented `discover()` returning `[]` for unauthorized queries.
6. **Explicit Test Coverage for HOD-301, 303, 310:** Added `test_vertex_gemma.py` and `test_rights_custodian_iam.py`.

**Key decisions:**
1. Single source of truth for IAM policies — `src/schema/iam_policy.py` generates documentation and enforces CI verification without hand-written drift.
2. Byte-identical inbound document preservation — Model Armor logs anomaly and emits event while keeping raw buyer document unmodified to prevent counterparty modification disputes.
3. Supervisor-written `TaskAbandoned` event — written exclusively by the Supervisor process when an agent deadline or circuit breaker trips.

**Requirements touched:** HOD-301, HOD-302, HOD-303, HOD-310, HOD-311, HOD-312, HOD-313, HOD-317, HOD-320, HOD-330, HOD-331, HOD-340, HOD-341, HOD-342, HOD-350

# Build Log — Hodi

Session log of development prompts, outcomes, key decisions, and requirements touched.

### 2026-08-06 — Phase 0 Skeleton & Live Evidence Endpoint Deployment (HOD-008)

**Prompt (verbatim):**
> Read docs/PRD.md and AGENTS.md in full before doing anything.
> 
> Part 1 — repo skeleton for Phase 0 (HOD-001 through HOD-010):
> - Directory layout per AGENTS.md, .gitkeep only, no stub logic
> - gitleaks pre-commit hook, .gitignore with SA key patterns, .env.example
> - Makefile with the five targets from AGENTS.md, each exiting 1 with "not implemented"
> - scripts/compliance.py: extract every HOD-### from PRD §4, diff against §2's matrix AND against IDs referenced in the PRD prose, exit nonzero on any orphan or range notation
> - docs/GATE.md with the three dated decisions and their pre-committed consequences, copied from PRD §4 HOD-006 — including the Aug 14 numeric pass bar
> - docs/BUILD-LOG.md and docs/FINDINGS.md, headers only
> 
> Part 2 — HOD-008, and this is the highest-priority item in the entire project because it is the only one where the deadline is physics rather than planning:
> 
> Deploy a Cloud Run service TODAY that serves a set of registered works and logs every access to Firestore: timestamp, path, user agent, IP, referrer, and whether robots.txt was fetched first. Serve /.well-known/hodi.json declaring Hodi terms, and a robots.txt that references it.
> 
> Keep it deliberately minimal — this is not the product, it is an instrument that must start collecting. min-instances=0, max-instances capped, no authentication on the public read path, structured logging.
> 
> By Aug 26 this must contain three weeks of genuine third-party access records. It cannot be backfilled. Deploy it before you write another line of anything else.
> 
> Then run make compliance and show me the output. The github repo we will be using is: https://github.com/Jeremiah-Sakuda/Hodi.

**Outcome:** Created full Phase 0 repository skeleton adhering to AGENTS.md structure and PRD v1.1. Deployed live evidence endpoint `hodi-evidence-endpoint` to Cloud Run (`https://hodi-evidence-endpoint-406699565497.us-central1.run.app`) logging access to Firestore Native. `make compliance` passed with 54 requirements verified.

**Key decisions:**
1. Explicit HOD-### expansion in `docs/PRD.md` — replaced range notations (`HOD-601–608`, `HOD-620–624`) with discrete requirement IDs across §2 matrix, §4, and prose so that `compliance.py` strictly verifies 1:1 coverage without range ambiguities.
2. Lightweight FastAPI service for evidence logging — selected FastAPI + `google-cloud-firestore` with `min-instances=0` and `--max-instances=5` to minimize cold starts while capping cost and resource footprint.

**Requirements touched:** HOD-001, HOD-002, HOD-004, HOD-005, HOD-006, HOD-007, HOD-008, HOD-009, HOD-010
